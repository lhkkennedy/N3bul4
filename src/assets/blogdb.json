Whether the makeup of the UK's energy supply was improving in the context of global warming. During one of these talks it was mentioned that the UK's fossil fuel industry had shrank in the last two decades. This is in fact true. Data from the ONS shows how our production of energy sources such as coal, natural gas and petroleum have seen a substantial fall but still significantly higher in relation to renewable sources.",
